# Real-Time PanGIA 
  <img src="PanGIA_logo.jpg" height=150 >

An implementation of the original PanGIA metagenomics taxonomy classifier, designed for real-time sequencing on ONT's nanopore-based sequencing platforms.

* Visualizes continuously-updated taxonomy classification of sequence reads from a nanopore sequencing platform.
* Multi-pronged confidence score associated with each taxonomy classification (from strain to superkingdom).
* Dynamic, real-time adjustment of displayed data. Only analyze what you want to analyze. 
* User-adjustable database with 'on-the-fly' additions of novel genomes for reads to be mapped against.
* Strain-level genome coverage plot visualizes read distribution across reference genomes, as well as taxa-specific and phenotype-specific marker genes and motifs.
